Simple SVAT (Soil Vegetation Atmosphere Transfer Models) model generating ET and soil moisture outputs. Includes aerodynamic, surface resistance calculation model. Also, it has canopy water balance module to estimate ET and simple soil moisture update module. The model has been prepared for the Quantitative Ecohydrology class (CIVE 625) as a course requirement. Currently, it can only simulate ET components and soil moisture for forest and grass type canipies.
